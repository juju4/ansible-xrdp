## Troubleshooting & Known issues

* xrdp requires a complex password (3 of lower, upper, number, special characters) else you may get login failed error. if error persist, try redefining user password just to be sure.

* xrdp can use X11, VNC or other interfaces. Those must be present and working.

* it is recommended to adapt your window manager to your network bandwidth, eg prefer lxde if low bandwidth.
